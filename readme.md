## Intro to Project

This project aims to develop and test a method for tracking the tongue tip and facial landmarks to measure the 3D position of the tongue tip. Using a triple-camera system, it records tongue movements of patients in various extreme positions to quantify the range of tongue motion. The collected data will be used to study the impact of treatments on tongue mobility. The project focuses on constructing a fixed facial reference coordinate system to express the 3D position of the tongue tip and evaluate the methodâ€™s effectiveness.

## Files description

- Codes: this includes the code we used but the address of some files need to be changed.
- Data: the position of all of the points we used. Format is : frame_count x_position y_position (z_position).
- Reference: some papers we referred to.

## Highlights

A key highlight of this project is the use of a machine algorithm combined with manual secondary verification to record tongue tip points, which ensures greater accuracy in the positioning of recorded points.
